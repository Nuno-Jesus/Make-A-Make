# Makefile Tutorial

## Description
This README was developed mainly to help 42 students to clear the fog around Makefiles and how they work. But, it will be for sure helpful to anyone out there struggling as well. 

It starts with a beginners guide, followed up by some medium-advanced concepts.

## <a name="index-1">1. What is make?</a>
The `make` utility is an automatic tool capable of deciding which commands can / should be executed. The `make` utility is mostly used to automate the compilation process, preventing manual file-by-file compilation. This utility is used through a special file called `Makefile`.

For the purposes of this guide, we'll only dispose of a C project.


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->


## <a name="index-2">2. An introduction to Makefiles</a>
Typically, a Makefile is called to handle compilation and linkage of a project and its files. The Makefile uses the modification times of the files it uses to assert if any need to be remade or not.

For instance, when compiling a `C` project, the final executable file, would be the zipped version of every `.o` file, which was in turn created from the `.c` files.

Let's create a simple project to work with. You can find this files in the [code](/code) folder.

	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->


## <a name="index-3">3. Rules</a>
Rules are the core of a Makefile. Rules define how, when and what files and commands are used to achieve the final executable.

A rule has the following syntax:

```Makefile
target: pre-requisit-1 pre-requisit-2 pre-requisit-3 ...
	command-1
	command-2
	command-3
	...
```

- A `target` is the name of a rule. Its, usually, also the name of a file, but not always.

- A rule can have dependencies, some stuff to be fulfilled before execution, named `pre-requisits`. A pre-requisit **can be either a file or another rule**. In the last case, the dependency rule is executed first. If the pre-requisit doesn't match neither a file or a rule's name, the Makefile halts and prints an error.

- Finally, after all pre-requisits are fulfilled, the rule can execute its `recipe`, a collection of `commands`. A rule can also have an empty recipe.

Each command should be indented with a **tab**, otherwise an error like this might show up:

	Makefile:38: *** missing separator.  Stop.

Here's an example of a perfectly valid rule that attempts to generate a `hello.o` file from a `hello.c` file:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	clang -c hello.c
```

The `clean` rule is used to clean temporary files. Those would be the object files in a C project:

```Makefile
clean:
	rm -rf hello.o
```

You can also have a similar rule to clean both object files and the executable:

```Makefile
fclean: clean
	rm -rf a.out
```

Finally, if you're lazy like me and need to re-compile everything, you might want to create a rule to clean and re-compile:

```Makefile
re: fclean all
```

<div align=center>
	<strong><a href="#index-0">ðŸš€ Go back to top ðŸš€</a></strong>
</div>


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->


## <a name="index-4">4. A simple Makefile</a>
The Makefile below is capable of compiling our example project. You can find it in the [code/example-1](/code/example-1/) folder.

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c

all: hello.o
	cc main.c hello.o

clean:
	rm -rf hello.o

fclean: clean
	rm -rf a.out

re: fclean all
```

Here's an image to display the dependencies in a more organized way:
<div align=center>
	<image src=images/graph_1.png>
</div>

In the terminal, run:

	make <target>

...where `<target>` is a list of targets you want to run. In this case, we need both `main.c` and `hello.c` file to be compiled, so you can run:

	make all

> **Warning**
> If the `<target>` field is ommited, the Makefile will execute the first rule. And yes, this example is not doing that, the primary rule should be 'all'.

You should see something like this on the terminal:

	cc -c hello.c
	cc main.c hello.o

This is great! The compilation worked out and finally we can execute our program and use our hello function! But what if one wanted to compile `N` more files? Would they need to create `N` more rules?


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->


## <a name="index-5">5. Variables</a>
Similar to programming languages, the Makefile syntax allows you to define variables. 

Variables allow you to focus your changes on one place, preventing error-prone implementations and repeated values across your Makefile.

Variables can only be strings (a single one or a list of strings). Here are some examples:

```Makefile
FIRST_NAMES := Nuno Miguel 				
LAST_NAMES  := Carvalho de Jesus
FULL_NAME   := $(FIRST_NAMES) $(LAST_NAMES) # Nuno Miguel Carvalho de Jesus
```

> **Note**: typically you should use the ':=' operator but '=' also works. 

> **Note**: the naming convention for variables is uppercase, to distinguish from Makefile rules. 

> **Note**: When more than one string is specified in a variable, it isn't considered as a string with spaces, but a list of strings.

You can use variables in rules and other variables as well. To access their values, you must use:

	$(FIRST_NAME)

or 

	${FIRST_NAME}

Let's add a few files to our project:

	â”œâ”€â”€ bye.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ highfive.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile

A naive solution would be to create more rules. You can find the code in the [code/example-2](/code/example-2/) folder:

```Makefile
all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c hello.o bye.o highfive.o

hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c

bye.o: bye.c
	cc -c bye.c

highfive.o: highfive.c
	cc -c highfive.c
```

This would be the new dependency graph:
<div align=center>
	<image src=images/graph_2.png>
</div>

But this is ugly and unnecessary since the pattern is always the same. Let us use the newly learn variables to clean this up! You can find the code in the [code/example-3](/code/example-3/) folder:

```Makefile
OBJS := hello.o bye.o highfive.o # Dependency list of the 'all' rule

all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<

clean:
	rm -rf $(OBJS)

...
```

Ok, pause. I know this is a lot to take in. Let's look into the details.When running `make`:

**1.** The `all` rule is chosen by default:

```Makefile
all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)
```

**2.** The `OBJS` variable is expanded its values, creating multiple dependencies:

```Makefile
all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c $(OBJS)
```

**3.** In the first compilation, the `hello.o` file doesn't exist. The dependency must then be remade, which forces the Makefile to look for a rule.

```Makefile
%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<
```

The `%` can be used in several cases. For this one, its used to represent a **Regular Expression (REGEX)**. You can read it as "any dependency that ends on `.o` can be generated here and needs a corresponding `.c` dependency with the same prefix". For `hello.o` we have:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c $< # The $< expands to the first dependency of this rule (hello.c)
```

The same goes for other dependencies having a `.o` suffix. The `$<` is an **Automatic Variable**. We'll talk more about Automatic Variables up ahead.Specifically this one is used to handle variable dependency strings, since the value of the dependency is not always the same. Final expansion:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c
```

**4.** Finally, after all dependencies are generated following the same pattern as before, the `all` rule can execute its recipe. The `OBJS` variable is expanded again to its values

```Makefile
all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c hello.o bye.o highfive.o
```

Here's what we have so far:

```Makefile
OBJS := hello.o bye.o highfive.o # Dependency list of the 'all' rule

all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<

clean:
	rm -rf $(OBJS)

fclean: clean
	rm -rf a.out

re: fclean all
```

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->


## <a name="index-6">6. Automatic variables</a>
Automatic variables are special variables used by the Makefile to dynamically compute values. In other words, you should use those, when a rule does not always have the same dependency or target name, like in the example above.

Below, is a table of some of the most useful ones:

<div>
	<table align=center width=100%>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<td align=center><strong>Variables</strong></td>
				<td align=center><strong>Description</strong></td>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td align=center><code>$@</code></td>
				<td>The name of a target rule</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align=center><code>$<</code></td>
				<td>The name of the first pre-requisit</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align=center><code>$^</code></td>
				<td>The name of all pre-requisits, separated by spaces</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align=center><code>$*</code></td>
				<td>The stem that matched the pattern of a rule</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>

You can find the code in the [code/example-4](/code/example-4/) folder:
```Makefile
all: lib.a this.example

lib.a: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	echo $@ # Prints "lib.a"
	echo $< # Prints "hello.o"
	echo $^ # Prints "hello.o bye.o highfive.o"
	$(AR) lib.a $^

%.example:
	echo $* # Prints "this"
```

## <a name="index-7">7. Towards a more flexible Makefile</a>

We are reaching the end of the tutorial! This section is all about polishing what we've developed so far. There will (much) more contents after this section, but its up to you to go further.

### <a name="index-7.1">7.1. Removing more redundancy</a>
Now that the basics are settled (at least they should be), let's have a look at some details. Noticed how the `rm -rf` and the `cc` commands are repeating? We can place them in variables:

```Makefile
CC      := cc
RM      := rm -rf
OBJS	:= hello.o bye.o highfive.o

all: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) -c $<

clean:
	$(RM) $(OBJS)

fclean: clean
	$(RM) a.out

re: fclean all
```

After a few hours, you realised your code is not that clean and you need a more secure compilation (compilation flags). You also want to name your executable `project`. For both cases we can define variables to avoid unecessary repetition. You can find the code in the [code/example-5](/code/example-5/) folder.
Here are the new changes:

```Makefile
CC      := cc
CFLAGS	:= -Wall -Werror -Wextra
RM      := rm -rf
NAME	:= project
OBJS	:= hello.o bye.o highfive.o

all: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

...

fclean: clean
	$(RM) $(NAME)

```

> **Note**: The `-o` flag signals the compiler, to specify the name the executable will have.

### <a name="index-7.2">7.2. Implicit Rules</a>
Have you tried to remove the `%.o: %.c` rule and run `make`? You'll soon find, the Makefile is still working. But how? Makefile has its own default rules defined for specific cases, like the ones you'll see below.
You can define your own implicit rules by using pattern rules (just like we did before).

**Implicit Rules**, also use **Implicit Variables**, which you can check in the next section. Here's some of the implicit rules:

<table align=center width=100%>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<td align=center><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
			<td align=center><strong>Rule</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr align=center>
			<td>Compiling C</td>
			<td><code>$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr align=center>
			<td>Compiling C++</td>
			<td><code>$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr align=center>
			<td>Generating .a</td>
			<td><code>$(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $@ $<</code></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<div align=center>
	<strong><a href="#index-0">ðŸš€ Go back to top ðŸš€</a></strong>
</div>


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->


### <a name="index-7.3">7.3. Implicit Variables</a>
As told before, implicit rules rely on variables already known by the Makefile, setted with a default value: **Implicit Variables**. You can redefine the value for these variables. Even if you don't use them explicitly, these new values can be used by implicit rules. Here's a table of some of them:


<table align=center width=100%>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<td align=center><strong>Name</strong></td>
			<td align=center><strong>Default value</strong></td>
			<td align=center><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>AR</code></td>
			<td><code>ar</code></td>
			<td>The command used to create archives, <code>.a</code> files</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>ARFLAGS</code></td>
			<td><code>-rv</code></td>
			<td>Used flags when <code>AR</code> command is issued</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>CC</code></td>
			<td><code>cc</code></td>
			<td>The default compiler to use when C compilation is required. The cc is not actually a compiler, but an alias to the default C compiler of your machine (either <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>CFLAGS</code></td>
			<td><code></code></td>
			<td>Used flags when <code>CC</code> command is issued</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>CXX</code></td>
			<td><code>g++</code></td>
			<td>The default compiler to use when C compilation is required.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>CXXFLAGS</code></td>
			<td><code></code></td>
			<td>Used flags when <code>CC</code> command is issued</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>RM</code></td>
			<td><code>rm -f</code></td>
			<td>The command to be used to permanently delete a file</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

### <a name="index-7.4">7.4. Relinking</a>
To wrap this simple tutorial, I would like you to run `make` several times. Have you noticed how the `main.c` and `.o` files are getting linked together, even though they haven't changed? This is a phenomenon called **relinking**.

Although it might not seem that important, considering a large scale project, relinking can cause unnecessary and larger compilation times. To avoid it, we can add as a dependency the executable file you are trying to create, like this:

```Makefile
...

NAME := project
all: $(NAME)

$(NAME): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)

...
```
You can find the code in the [code/example-6](/code/example-6/) folder.
This version does the same job as before. The main difference lies on the new dependency of `all`. The first compilation will assert the project executable is not a file, so it must be remade through the `$(NAME)` rule. In the second compilation, since the `project` file was created before, the dependency is fulfilled and the Makefile directly executes the `all` recipe. Since it's empty, you'll get this message:

	make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.

And there you have it! I hope this beginner's guide cleared a bit of your doubts. If you're not a beginner (or don't want to be one anymore), I advise you to check the contents up ahead. Many of those might be useful to change and upgrade your Makefiles!
