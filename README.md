## <a name="index-1">What is make?</a>

The make utility is an automatic tool capable of deciding which commands can / should be executed. Mostly, the make is used to automate the compilation process, preventing manual file-by-file compilation. This utility is used through a special file called `Makefile`.

This tutorial will only display a Makefile with C files, but it can be used with any language.

## <a name="index-2">An introduction to Makefiles</a>
Typically, a Makefile is called to handle compilation and linkage of a project and its files.

For instance, when compiling a `C` project, the final executable file, would be the zipped version of every `.o` file, which was in turn created from the `.c` files.

Let's create a simple project to work with. You can find this files in the [code](/code) folder.

	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile

## <a name="index-3">Rules</a>
Rules are the core of a Makefile. Rules define how, when and what files and commands are used to achieve the final executable.

A rule has the following syntax:

```Makefile
target: pre-requisit-1 pre-requisit-2 pre-requisit-3 ...
	command-1
	command-2
	command-3
	...
```

- A `target` is the name of a rule. Its, usually, also the name of a file, but not always.

- A rule can have dependencies, some stuff to be fulfilled before execution, named `pre-requisits`. A pre-requisit **can be either a file or another rule**. In the last case, the dependency rule is executed first. If the pre-requisit doesn't match neither a file or a rule's name, the Makefile halts and prints an error.

- Finally, after all pre-requisits are fulfilled, the rule can execute its `recipe`, a collection of `commands`. A rule can also have an empty recipe.

Each command should be indented with a **tab**, otherwise an error like this might show up:

	Makefile:38: *** missing separator.  Stop.

Here's an example of a perfectly valid rule that attempts to generate a `hello.o` file from a `hello.c` file:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	clang -c hello.c
```

The `clean` rule is used to clean temporary files. Those would be the object files in a C project:

```Makefile
clean:
	rm -rf hello.o
```

You can also have a similar rule to clean both object files and the executable:

```Makefile
fclean: clean
	rm -rf a.out
```

Finally, if you're lazy like me and need to re-compile everything, you might want to create a rule to clean and re-compile:

```Makefile
re: fclean all
```

<div align=center>
	<strong><a href="#index-0">ðŸš€ Go back to top ðŸš€</a></strong>
</div>

## <a name="index-4">A simple Makefile</a>
The Makefile bellow is capable of compiling our example project. 

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c

all: hello.o
	cc main.c hello.o

clean:
	rm -rf hello.o

fclean: clean
	rm -rf a.out

re: fclean all
```

Here's an image to display the dependencies in a more organized way:
<div align=center>
	<image src=images/graph_1.png>
</div>

In the terminal, run:

	make <target>

...where `<target>` is the name of the rule you want to run. In this case, we need both `main.c` and `hello.c` file to be compiled, so you can run:

	make all

> **Warning**
> If the `<target>` field is ommited, the Makefile will execute the first rule. And yes, this example is not doing that, the primary rule should be 'all'.

You should see something like this on the terminal:

	cc -c hello.c
	cc main.c hello.o

This is great! The compilation worked out and finally we can execute our program and print "Hello World!"! But what if one wanted to compile `N` more files? Would they need to create `N` more rules?

## <a name="index-5">Variables</a>
Similar to programming languages, the Makefile syntax allows you to define variables. Variables can only be strings (a single one or a list of strings). Here are some examples:

```Makefile
FIRST_NAMES := Nuno Miguel 				
LAST_NAMES := Carvalho de Jesus
FULL_NAME := $(FIRST_NAMES) $(LAST_NAMES) # Nuno Miguel Carvalho de Jesus
```

> **Note**: typically you should use the ':=' operator but '=' also works. 

> **Note**: the naming convention for variables is uppercase, to distinguish from Makefile rules. 

> **Note**: When more than one string is specified in a variable, it isn't considered as a string with spaces, but a list of strings.

You can use variables in rules and other variables as well. To access their values, you must use:

	$(FIRST_NAME)

or 

	${FIRST_NAME}

Let's expand our project and add some more files:

	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ bye.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ highfive.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile

A naive solution would be to create more rules:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c

bye.o: bye.c
	cc -c bye.c

highfive.o: highfive.c
	cc -c highfive.c

all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c hello.o bye.o highfive.o
```

This would be the new dependency graph:
<div align=center>
	<image src=images/graph_2.png>
</div>

But this is ugly and unnecessary since the pattern is always the same. Let us use the newly learn variables to clean this up!

```Makefile
OBJS := hello.o bye.o highfive.o # Dependency list of the 'all' rule

all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<
```

Variables allow you to focus your changes on one place, preventing error-prone implementations and repeated values across your Makefile.

Ok, pause. I know this is a lot to take in. Let's look into the details.When running `make`:

**1.** The `all` rule is chosen by default:

```Makefile
all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)
```

**2.** The `OBJS` variable is expanded its values, creating multiple dependencies:

```Makefile
all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c $(OBJS)
```

**3.** In the first compilation, the `hello.o` file doesn't exist. The dependency must then be remade, which forces the .

```Makefile
%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<
```

The `%` can be used in several cases.For this one, its used to represent a **Regular Expression (REGEX)**. You can read it as "any dependency that ends on `.o` can be generated here and needs a corresponding `.c` dependency with the same prefix". For `hello.o` we have:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c $< # The $< expands to the first dependency of this rule (hello.c)
```

The same goes for other dependencies having a `.o` suffix. The `$<` is an **Automatic Variable** (learn more about Automatic variables [here](#index-4)), used to handle variable dependency strings. Final expansion:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c
```

**4.** Finally, after all dependencies are fulfilled, the `all` rule can execute its recipe. The `OBJS` variable is expanded again to its values

```Makefile
all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c hello.o bye.o highfive.o
```

Here's what we have so far:

```Makefile
OBJS := hello.o bye.o highfive.o # Dependency list of the 'all' rule

all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<

clean:
	rm -rf $(OBJS)

fclean: clean
	rm -rf a.out

re: fclean all
```

</div>

## <a name="index-6">Towards a more flexible Makefile</a>
Now that the basics are settled (at least they should be), let's have a look at some details. Noticed how the `rm -rf` and the `cc` commands are repeating? We can place them in variables:

```Makefile
CC		:= cc
RM		:= rm -rf
OBJS	:= hello.o bye.o highfive.o

all: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) -c $<

clean:
	$(RM) $(OBJS)

fclean: clean
	$(RM) a.out

re: fclean all
```

Suppose now, you need a more secure compilation, so you need compilation flags. You also want to name your executable `final`. For both cases we can define variables to avoid unecessary repetition. The `-o` flag is part of the `cc` compiler, which allows you to specify which name the executable will have.
Here are the new changes:

```Makefile
CC		:= cc
CFLAGS	:= -Wall -Werror -Wextra
RM		:= rm -rf
NAME	:= final
OBJS	:= hello.o bye.o highfive.o

all: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

...

fclean: clean
	$(RM) $(NAME)

```

> **Note**: the CC and CFLAGS names are not randomly chosen...

Have you tried to remove the `%.o: %.c` rule? Is the Makefile still working? If you are confused about it, check the [Implicit Rules](#index-0) and [Builtin Variables](#index-0) section.




<!-- 

## <a name="index-4">Implicit rules</a> 
	Implicit rule for C:
		$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c
	Implicit rule for C++:
		$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c

## <a name="index-4">Relinking</a>
Relinking is mentioned whenever your makefile compiles your files, over and over again, even though no modifications were performed.

## <a name="index-4">Builtin target names</a> 
.SILENT: silences all the commands printed on the output
.PHONY: used to tell the Makefile to not confuse the names of the targets with filenames. For instance, having a file called `hello`, should not enter in conflict with the `hello` rule
.DEFAULT_GOAL: used to define what is the primary target of the makefile. For instance, even if the clean rule is not the first, if defined in this macro, it will be executed when running solely 'make'.

## <a name="index-4">Builtin variables</a>
Some variables are already recognized by the Makefile when given a certain name. Those are the variables the Makefile will use to execute the implicit rules. Here are some useful variables:
	AR("ar") - used to create archives, .a files
	CC("cc") - the default compiler to use when compiling C programs
	CXX("g++") - the default compiler to use when compiling C++ programs
	ARFLAGS("-rv") - flags to work with AR
	CFLAGS("") - extra flags to work with CC
	CXXFLAGS("") - extra flags to work with CXX
	
## <a name="index-4">Automatic variables</a>
	$@ - The target name
	$< - The name of the first pre requisite
	$^ - The name of all the pre requisites, separated by spaces

## <a name="index-4">Typical errors</a>

## <a name="index-4">Useful flags</a>
-C <directory> Call another makefile located at <dir>
-k Continue as much as possible after an error occurred.
-s Turns off printing of the makefile actions in the terminal
-r Tells the makefile to ignore any builtin rules
-j<number of threads> Allows parallel computation of makefile actions. Needs $(MAKE) to work properly.
-n Displays the commands the makefile would run without actually running them
--debug Displays the thinking process of the makefile before executing any targets
--no-print-directory Disables message printing of whenever the makefile enters or exits a directory
