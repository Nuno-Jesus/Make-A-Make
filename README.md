## <a name="index-1">What is make?</a>

The make utility is an automatic tool capable of deciding which commands can / should be executed. Mostly, the make is used to automate the compilation process, preventing manual file-by-file compilation. This utility is used through a special file called `Makefile`.

This tutorial will only display a Makefile with C files, but it can be used with any language.

## <a name="index-2">Introduction to Makefiles</a>
Typically, a Makefile is called to handle compilation and linkage of a project and its files.

For instance, when compiling a `C` project, the final executable file, would be the zipped version of every `.o` file, which was in turn created from the `.c` files.

Let's create a simple project to work with. You can find this files in the [code](/code) folder.

	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile

## <a name="index-4">Makefile rules</a>
Rules are the core of a Makefile. Rules define how, when and what files and commands are used to achieve the final executable.

A rule has the following syntax:

	target: pre-requisit-1 pre-requisit-2 pre-requisit-3 ...
		command-1
		command-2
		command-3
		...

- A `target` is the name of a rule. Usually, it is also the name of a compilation related file, but not always.

- A rule can (can have 0) have dependecies, something to be fulfilled before its own execution, named `pre-requisits`. A pre-requisit can be either the name of a file or the name of another rule. In the last case, the dependecy rule is executed first. If the pre-requisit does not match neither a file or rule name, the Makefile will halt with and print an error.

- Finally, after all pre-requisits, the rule can execute its `recipe`, a collection of `commands`. A rule can also have an empty recipe.

Each command should be indented with a tab, otherwise an error like this might show up:

	Makefile:38: *** missing separator.  Stop.

Here's an example of a perfectly valid rule that attempts to generate a `hello.o` file from a `hello.c` file:

	hello.o: hello.c
		clang -c hello.c

## <a name="index-5">Your first Makefile</a>
The Makefile bellow is capable of compiling our example project. 

	hello.o: hello.c
		cc -c hello.c

	all: hello.o
		cc main.c hello.o

In the terminal, you must use the following command:

	make target

...where `target` is the name of the rule you want to run. In this case, we need both main.c and hello.c file to be compiled, so you must run:

	make all

> **Warning**
> If no rule is specified, the Makefile will execute the very first rule (from top to bottom). Make sure you place your default rule above all others. Yes, this example is not doing that.

You should see something like this on the terminal:

	cc -c hello.c
	cc main.c hello.o

This is great! The compilation worked out and finally we can execute our program and print "Hello World!"! But what if one was to create `N` more files, would they need to create `N` more rules?

<!-- 

## <a name="index-4">Implicit rules</a> 
	Implicit rule for C:
		$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c
	Implicit rule for C++:
		$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c

## <a name="index-4">Relinking</a>
Relinking is mentioned whenever your makefile compiles your files, over and over again, even though no modifications were performed.


## <a name="index-4">Special rules</a> 
.SILENT: silences all the commands printed on the output
.PHONY: used to tell the Makefile to not confuse the names of the targets with filenames. For instance, having a file called `hello`, should not enter in conflict with the `hello` rule

## <a name="index-4">Builtin variables</a>
Some variables are already recognized by the Makefile when given a certain name. Those are the variables the Makefile will use to execute the implicit rules. Here are some useful variables:
	AR("ar") - used to create archives, .a files
	CC("cc") - the default compiler to use when compiling C programs
	CXX("g++") - the default compiler to use when compiling C++ programs
	ARFLAGS("-rv") - flags to work with AR
	CFLAGS("") - extra flags to work with CC
	CXXFLAGS("") - extra flags to work with CXX
	
## <a name="index-4">Automatic variables</a>
	$@ - The target name
	$< - The name of the first pre requisite
	$^ - The name of all the pre requisites, separated by spaces

## <a name="index-4">Typical errors</a>
