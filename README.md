## <a name="index-1">What is make?</a>

The make utility is an automatic tool capable of deciding which commands can / should be executed. Mostly, the make is used to automate the compilation process, preventing manual file-by-file compilation. This utility is used through a special file called `Makefile`.

This tutorial will only display a Makefile with C files, but it can be used with any language.

## <a name="index-2">Introduction to Makefiles</a>
Typically, a Makefile is called to handle compilation and linkage of a project and its files.

For instance, when compiling a `C` project, the final executable file, would be the zipped version of every `.o` file, which was in turn created from the `.c` files.

Let's create a simple project to work with. You can find this files in the [code](/code) folder.

	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile

## <a name="index-4">Makefile rules</a>
Rules are the core of a Makefile. Rules define how, when and what files and commands are used to achieve the final executable.

A rule has the following syntax:

	target: pre-requisit-1 pre-requisit-2 pre-requisit-3 ...
		command-1
		command-2
		command-3
		...

- A `target` is the name of a rule. Its, usually, also the name of a file, but not always.

- A rule can (can have 0) have dependecies, something to be fulfilled before its own execution, named `pre-requisits`. A pre-requisit **can be either a file another rule**. In the last case, the dependecy rule is executed first. If the pre-requisit does not match neither a file or rule name, the Makefile will halt with and print an error.

- Finally, after all pre-requisits are fullfilled, the rule can execute its `recipe`, a collection of `commands`. A rule can also have an empty recipe.

Each command should be indented with a **tab**, otherwise an error like this might show up:

	Makefile:38: *** missing separator.  Stop.

Here's an example of a perfectly valid rule that attempts to generate a `hello.o` file from a `hello.c` file:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	clang -c hello.c
```

## <a name="index-5">Your first Makefile</a>
The Makefile bellow is capable of compiling our example project. 

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c

all: hello.o
	cc main.c hello.o
```

Here's an image to display the dependencies in a more organized way:
<!--                                                       -->
<!--                                                       -->
<!--                  PLACE AN IMAGE HERE                  -->
<!--                                                       -->
<!--                                                       -->


In the terminal, you must use the following command:

	make <target>

...where `target` is the name of the rule you want to run. In this case, we need both `main.c` and `hello.c` file to be compiled, so you must run:

	make all

> **Note**
> If if the target field is ommited, by default, the first written rule will be executed (from top to bottom). Make sure you place your primary rule above all others. And yes, this example is not doing that, the primary rule should be 'all'.

<!--                                                         -->
<!--                                                         -->
<!--                  TALK ABOUT CLEAN RULE                  -->
<!--                                                         -->
<!--                                                         -->

<!--                                                         -->
<!--                                                         -->
<!--                    TALK ABOUT RE RULE                   -->
<!--                                                         -->
<!--                                                         -->

You should see something like this on the terminal:
```zsh
cc -c hello.c
cc main.c hello.o
```

This is great! The compilation worked out and finally we can execute our program and print "Hello World!"! But what if one was to create `N` more files, would they need to create `N` more rules?

## <a name="index-6">Variables</a>
Similar to programming languages, the Makefile syntax allows you to define variables. Variables can only be strings (a single one or a list of strings). Here are some examples:

```Makefile
FIRST_NAMES := Nuno Miguel 				
LAST_NAMES := Carvalho de Jesus
FULL_NAME := $(FIRST_NAMES) $(LAST_NAMES) #
```

> **Note**: typically you should use the ':=' operator but '=' also works. 

> **Note**: the naming convention for variables is uppercase, to distinguish from Makefile rules. 

> **Note**: When more than one string is specified in a variable, it isn't considered as a string with spaces, but a list of strings.

You can use variables in rules and other variables as well. To access their values, you must use the "$(VARIABLE_NAME_HERE)" or the "${VARIABLE_NAME_HERE}" syntax.

Let's expand our project and add some more files:

	â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ bye.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ highfive.c 
	â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
	â””â”€â”€ Makefile

A naive solution to update the Makefile would be to create more rules:

```Makefile
hello.o: hello.c
	cc -c hello.c

bye.o: bye.c
	cc -c bye.c

highfive.o: highfive.c
	cc -c highfive.c

all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c hello.o bye.o highfive.o
```

This would be the new dependency graph:
<!--                                                       -->
<!--                                                       -->
<!--                  PLACE AN IMAGE HERE                  -->
<!--                                                       -->
<!--                                                       -->

But this is very much redundant, since the command in each recipe is the same. You are only changing the filename. Let us use the newly learn variables to clean this up!

```Makefile
OBJS := hello.o bye.o highfive.o # Dependency list of the 'all' rule

all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
	cc -c $<

```

Ok, pause. I know this is a lot to take in, let's break it in pieces. When running `make`:

1. The all rule is executed.

```Makefile
all: $(OBJS)
	cc main.c $(OBJS)
```

2. The `OBJS` variable is expanded its values, creating multiple dependencies

```Makefile
all: hello.o bye.o highfive.o
	cc main.c $(OBJS)
```

## <a name="index-4">Implicit rules</a> 
	Implicit rule for C:
		$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c
	Implicit rule for C++:
		$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c

## <a name="index-4">Relinking</a>
Relinking is mentioned whenever your makefile compiles your files, over and over again, even though no modifications were performed.

## <a name="index-4">Builtin target names</a> 
.SILENT: silences all the commands printed on the output
.PHONY: used to tell the Makefile to not confuse the names of the targets with filenames. For instance, having a file called `hello`, should not enter in conflict with the `hello` rule
.DEFAULT_GOAL: used to define what is the primary target of the makefile. For instance, even if the clean rule is not the first, if defined in this macro, it will be executed when running solely 'make'.

## <a name="index-4">Builtin variables</a>
Some variables are already recognized by the Makefile when given a certain name. Those are the variables the Makefile will use to execute the implicit rules. Here are some useful variables:
	AR("ar") - used to create archives, .a files
	CC("cc") - the default compiler to use when compiling C programs
	CXX("g++") - the default compiler to use when compiling C++ programs
	ARFLAGS("-rv") - flags to work with AR
	CFLAGS("") - extra flags to work with CC
	CXXFLAGS("") - extra flags to work with CXX
	
## <a name="index-4">Automatic variables</a>
	$@ - The target name
	$< - The name of the first pre requisite
	$^ - The name of all the pre requisites, separated by spaces

## <a name="index-4">Typical errors</a>

## <a name="index-4">Useful flags</a>
-C <directory> Call another makefile located at <dir>
-k Continue as much as possible after an error occurred.
-s Turns off printing of the makefile actions in the terminal
-r Tells the makefile to ignore any builtin rules
-j<number of threads> Allows parallel computation of makefile actions. Needs $(MAKE) to work properly.
-n Displays the commands the makefile would run without actually running them
--debug Displays the thinking process of the makefile before executing any targets
--no-print-directory Disables message printing of whenever the makefile enters or exits a directory
